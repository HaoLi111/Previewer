## Previewer: A systematic previewer for multivariable data

# Plan: 
An interactive previewer for multivariable dataset. Combining the functionalities of various packages and covers both plot, models, data, and code.


To bring together the functions of
 - tidyverse (ggplot/dplyr/GGally)
 - Trellis-lattice (psych etc.)
 - caret
 - visreg
 - misc3d-plot3d
 
 and basic functionalities of R to create a:

 - safer
 - more systematic
 - more considerate
 
 preview with:
 
 - implementation of exploratory, explanatory and predictive models
 - consistent minimalistic graphic style
 - sematic parameters/ reporting functions and pivot tables
 - auto-generation of analysis code
 
# Reference
  The intro video gives an outline, but to fully understand the functionalities, it is recommended to have a view on multi-var stats systematically.
